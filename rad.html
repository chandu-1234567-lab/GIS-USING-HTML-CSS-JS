<mark>Low-level Waste:</mark><br>
Low-level waste disposal is simple and may be done practically any place in a safe manner.

<li>Care should be taken to check manmade radiation pollution at source.</li>
<li>Nuclear reactor should be perfectly maintained to avoid accidental leakage.</li>
<li>Since storage may not be practicable, another alternative is to dilute the radiation.</li>
<li>Nuclear tests should be banned.</li>
<li>Deep Geological Disposal: The greatest solution for the eventual disposal of the most radioactive waste produced is deep geological disposal, which is widely accepted.</li>
