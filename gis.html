At present Gujarat has only 2% of the country’s water resources with 5% of the population.Further, more than 40% of rain flows into the sea as runoff every yeast due to the absence of water conservation structures. The state government has shown some willingness to fix the issue in the form of a document as Vision 2020 but nothing goes as per the plan.The Gujarat Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, resolved to implement the Jal Jeevan Mission, aiming that each rural household has a tap connection.'

Of this, around 29% is lost to the sea, 61% is transferred from one place to another, and 10% is deposited in reservoirs.Despite large-scale soil degradation, food production has increased due to technological inputs, and now India is the second largest producer of farm produce. While today, the country is self-sufficient in food production, it will have to import food in the years to come if its soil continues to degrade, especially considering that India, with just 2.4% of the world land area, has 18% of the world population to feed.',
