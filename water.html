<mark>Use fewer chemicals to clean your home.</mark><br>
Natural cleaners are just as effective at getting the house clean. It's an easy switch that makes a big difference. Using toxic chemicals like bleach and ammonia to clean your home is not only bad for the water supply, it's not necessary. With natural cleaners, you don't have to worry that you're contributing to water pollution when you use them.

<mark>Dispose of waste properly.:</mark><br>
Never pour something that isn't biodegradable down the drain. When it is necessary to use something that's toxic to the water supply, such as paint or ammonia, take care to dispose of it properly. If you're not sure how to get rid of something, check your local government's website or contact your sanitation department to find out how toxic waste should be disposed of in your community.

<mark>Don't flush medication:</mark><br>
Use a local “take back” program for safe disposal instead. Medication is made with a variety of substances that can be detrimental to the water supply. Local "take back" programs allow you to turn in medication so it can be disposed of properly and without any risk of contamination. That way it won't end up back in the drinking water, where it can harm people and animals.
