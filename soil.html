<mark>Get a better understanding of the soil environment quality baseline</mark><br>
In order to properly control and prevent soil erosion, it is paramount that every stakeholder understands the baseline of soil environment quality, which can be done by carrying out sensitizations and surveys on soil pollution.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;

<mark>Develop necessary legislation on soil pollution control:</mark><br>
Although efforts are being put in place to ensure soil pollution control, the process ought to be accelerated by drafting the necessary legislation. The existing registrations such as urban and rural planning, agricultural practices, and land management should be revised and updated to include contemporary soil pollution control and prevention measures
<br>

<br>

<mark>Proper Solid Waste Treatment:</mark><br>
It is important to dispose of solid waste properly by treated it before itâ€™s released into the environment. Acidic and alkaline waste, for example, can be neutralized before they are disposed of to avoid soil contamination. Biodegradable waste should also be broken down in a controlled environment before it is released into the environment. A great example is the proper treatment of sewage sludge.
